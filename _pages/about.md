Hello! I am Mingjie DUAN (Josie), currently an M.Phil. student in [Department of Geography](https://geog.hk.hk) at The University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. HUANG Bo](https://hub.hku.hk/cris/rp/rp03146;jsessionid=23937E2088A0918E7026322DFC259D34). I earned my BSc (Hons) in Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2025, where I completed a thesis on enhancing green space accessibility for different age groups in Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. ZHU Xiaolin](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lsgi/people/academic-staff/prof-zhu-xiao-lin/?sc_lang=en). My current research interests lie at the intersection of geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and urban sustainability. I am particularly passionate about applying GIS and environmental informatics to real-world challenges such as green space planning, transportation optimization, and climate-resilient urban development.

I have co-authored multiple peer-reviewed journal articles in high-impact publications such as Remote Sensing of Environment, Agricultural Systems, and the ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. My work focuses on satellite data processing, land-use classification, and environmental monitoring, with an emphasis on developing robust, scalable algorithms. (You can also use google scholar badge to browse my work<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QcrNo4IAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

Beyond research, I have a strong interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. I have participated in various international competitions and hackathons, including the HKAES Pitch Competition, where I won the Champion Award for a project on AI-enhanced airport optimization, and the Cathay Hackathon, where I received the Best GBA Solution Award. I’ve also led projects on intelligent waste-sorting robots, sustainable housing solutions, and seasonal thermal energy storage.
